## VIEW BINDING FOR RECYCLERVIEWS WITH MULTIPLE ITEMS LAYOUT


!!! [[fa=fa-android /] Android Official Page on RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview)

#### What is a RecyclerView?

RecyclerView is a powerful and relatively easy way to create lists in Android. This tutorial won't cover the basics, so if you need to learn about it or refresh your memory, follow the link at the top of the page.


#### Why would we need to use different items layout?

There can be various reasons to do this: a typical one I can think of is showing different states for the items.
Let's say you have a list of people and want to add a green border and a check symbol when they're tapped. Or maybe you have a list of items that need to display a different kind or number of pieces of information, according to their category.
