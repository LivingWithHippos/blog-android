# [center]ANDROID IN BITS[/center]

> I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple’s $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong. I’m going to destroy Android, because it’s a stolen product. - Steve Jobs

Coding has always given me great satisfaction. The first time I ran my two hundred lines of code and saw how fast they completed, I fell in love. It was a simple program to move a dot on the screen according to what button you pressed, written in [Dark Basic](https://www.thegamecreators.com/product/dark-basic-pro-open-source), a now-defunct language inspired by BASIC. Over the years, I studied Java at school, Python for my thesis, and now Kotlin. 

Thanks to an Embedded Programming university course, I discovered Android and immediately liked it. I don't know why writing software that could run on your handheld device clicked with me. After some time, the material design [guidelines](https://material.io/design/) came out, and applications started to look good too.

This blog will contain guides, tips and tricks related to Android development. It will be mostly written for Kotlin since it's now an official Programming Language for Android, and it introduces several features that make programming more enjoyable.
