# Android Blog

I'm using this repository as a backup of my Android blog and also to get feedback, correct errors, or push changes from Github if I find a better Markdown editor than the one provided by [Grav](https://getgrav.org/).

Feel free to open an issue if you spot an error.

Synced thanks to the [Git Sync Grav plugin](https://github.com/trilbymedia/grav-plugin-git-sync).
